About ConPlot
+++++++++++++

ConPlot is a web-based application for the visualisation of information derived from residue contact predictions in combination with other sources of information, such as secondary structure predictions, transmembrane helical topology, sequence conservation. The plot allows the visual cross-referencing of sequence-based prediction data from multiple sources. The exploitation of this novel cross-referencing method can be useful to potentially expose structural features that would otherwise go undetected. Developed by the the `Rigden <https://github.com/rigdenlab>`_ group at the `University of Liverpool <https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/>`_, this new tool provides an interactive interface for researchers in the field of protein bioinformatics that are interested in analysing data on a given protein at a glance.
