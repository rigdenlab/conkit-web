## About ConPlot


ConPlot is a web-based application for the visualisation of information
derived from residue contact predictions in combination with other
sources of information, such as secondary structure predictions,
transmembrane helical topology, sequence conservation. The plot allows
the visual cross-referencing of sequence-based prediction data from
multiple sources. The exploitation of this novel cross-referencing
method can be useful to potentially expose structural features that
would otherwise go undetected. Developed by the the
[Rigden](https://github.com/rigdenlab) group at the [University of
Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), this new tool provides an
interactive interface for researchers in the field of protein
bioinformatics that are interested in analysing data on a given protein
at a glance.
